Here you can write more complex mathematical expressions using the keyboard, and a list of functions and constants. You can also define your own expressions. For example, if you write

inc(x) = x + 1

and click "Run", it will create a new function which will increment the given number by 1. The expression will be stored, so you can access it the next time you open the calculator.

Fx Calculator is written in Scala 3, with JavaFX and Gluon libraries for GUI, and GraalVM Native Image for compilation. It's a pretty unique combination of technologies for an Android app. If you want to learn more, go to https://github.com/makingthematrix/scalaonandroid
